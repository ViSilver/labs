# Laboratory work nr. 0 (intro to the course and future challenges)

### No deadlines -> luck you! (at least for a while)
### Still have to get to know with new programming languages

Welcome young padawans, to the first special mathematics lab (and we are starting counting from zero because we are programmers). Here you have the opportunity to step into the ancient and sacred art of probability and discrete math. If you are brave enough, which I think you are, you will undergo a unique and intensive training that will awake the force within each of you to take the path of new opportunities and adventures.

#### Note
The exercises can be solved using whatever programming language you want, but keep in mind that assistance will be given mostly to **Python**. The aim of this course is getting you to know with the basics and some intermediate techniques of probability and discrete math. In the end, the points will be given just to the correctness of the solutions to the given tasks.

 As I said, I advice you to start learning **Python** programming language. I know that the vast majority of you has mastered only **C**, but don't worry. **Python** is a high level language *(soon I'll give you some insight about high level languages)* that is really easy to learn. Using **Python** you can easily shape solutions to your problems due to the fact that it's backed up by many libraries that cover a large spectrum of domains and that are up-to-date with the latest and best mathematical theorems and algorithms.

### Python environment setup
I assume that most of you run a Windows machine that's why I recommend installing **Anaconda** environment. It comes with a python interpreter *(more bout interpreting and compiling source code click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaj7nO1HUqA))* an editor and a REPL *(something that executes instantly every line of code that you type)* and also it has tons of useful libraries required by lab exercises. Here is the [official anaconda page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) where you can download the application.

If you don't want to install anaconda, you may choose to install **pip** *(but only after you install python)* for library management. You can download the **get-pip.py** file from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) *(note that you have to save it with .py extension, not a .txt or .html one)*. After saving, go to the directory where the **get-pip.py** was saved and compile it using 

```shell
python get-pip.py
```

A full guide on how to install pip you can find [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). I recommend using **pip** over **anaconda** as it can seem quite overwhelming for beginners.

#### Note
When you'll google `"Python"`, you might stumble upon different versions of it. **Python 2.7** is the old one and **Python 3.x** is the new one. Of course we'll be using the new one. They actually are two different programming languages (though might not look very different). Please do not mistake the python version.

##### Tip
Try to include the python version in your *Google query*, ex: `"I have some specific error python 3"`. This approach might help you to find faster the solution.


### An introduction to Python
[In this link](https://github.com/ViSilver/labs/blob/master/ms/lab0/intro_to_python.md) is a long list of code snippets with explanatory comments. Please go thoroughly through them and try to understand most of them. After you succeed you will be ready to solve  the exercises. [Here you can find the original source](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/) of code snippets, that is just in case the trimmed version was not enough for you. I strongly recommend not to go through it unless you're not a beginner to python, or you're accustomed to some other OOP (Object Oriented Programming) languages.
